-- We need to make sure that we can contact students through a phone number or through email. If student's don't have a phone number or email associated with their account, we'll need to message them on slack to update their details.

-- Instruction
-- Get all of the students that don't have an email or phone number.

-- Get their name, id, and cohort_id.


SELECT students.name, students.id, students.cohort_id 
FROM students
WHERE phone IS NULL OR email IS NULL;
